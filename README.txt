Seatmap Availability Exercise:

Write a python script that parses the example seatmap response (OTA_AirSeatMapRS.xml) and return a JSON object that lists the seats with the next properties:
	- Type (Seat, Kitchen, Bathroom, etc)
	- Seat id (17A, 18A)
	- Seat price
	- Cabin class
	- Availability

And any other properties you might find interesting or useful.

The output json format is not defined, so feel free to choose whatever you think best represents the information
